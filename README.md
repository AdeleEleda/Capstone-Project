Data Cleaning
see "capstone_data_cleaning.ipynb"

In this notebook we will clean and combine the raw data in CSVs collected from the publicly available Hourly Load Data Archives. These data sets contain the hourly energy load, measured in MW, for the eight regions that make up the electric grid monitored by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and spans from 2008-2019. The goal of cleaning and compiling the data into one CSV is to build statistical models in order to forecast future energy demand.
